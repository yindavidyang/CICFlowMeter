# Python Port Parity TODO

The Python package currently covers only the core flow data structures and metrics. The following work remains to reach feature parity with the Java CICFlowMeter toolchain.

- **PCAP ingestion layer** *(done)*: implemented as `cicflowmeter.packet_reader.PacketReader`, covering IPv4/IPv6 TCP/UDP decoding and timestamp tracking.
- **Batch CLI pipeline** *(done)*: use `cicflowmeter.cli:main` (exposed via the `cicflowmeter` console script) to enumerate PCAP files, run the flow generator, and emit CSV flow reports.
- **Real-time capture & listeners** *(done)*: implemented as `cicflowmeter.live_capture.LiveCapture`, which wraps a Scapy `AsyncSniffer` and forwards packets through the `FlowGenerator` listener API.
- **GUI / operator tooling** *(in progress)*: the PySide6 operator console (`cicflowmeter-gui`) now offers live-capture controls, a rolling flow table, configurable analytics (metric selection, PCA projection, color-coded clustering, optional 3D scatter), cluster drill-down/export, and batch PCAP â†’ CSV orchestration with cancellation, saved presets, inline CSV previews, rerun shortcuts, and recent artifact access. Remaining work to match the Swing UI includes richer clustering visualizations (e.g., multi-metric drill-ins, anomaly alerts, streaming dashboards) and advanced alerting widgets located in `src/main/java/cic/cs/unb/ca/flow/ui` and `swing/common`.
- **Visualization & clustering**: translate the Weka-based clustering/dimensionality-reduction pipeline (`src/main/java/cic/cs/unb/ca/weka`) to Python using libraries such as scikit-learn or seaborn/matplotlib, and integrate it with whichever UI or reporting surfaces replace the Java charts.
- **Ancillary utilities** *(done)*: implemented in `cicflowmeter.ancillary` with incremental CSV writing plus helpers for IP endpoint summaries and time-bucket aggregation exposed through `FlowGenerator`.

Documenting these gaps early should help guide scope decisions (e.g., whether to keep the Python port headless or to match the full Java UX).
